# Python Email Generator
This project is a Python-based email generator that creates and sends product promotion emails.

## Overview
The Python Email Generator automates the process of creating and sending product promotion emails. It's particularly useful for businesses or marketers who want to efficiently reach out to their customers with visually appealing email campaigns featuring product banners.

## Project Structure
- `.env` : Configuration file containing environment variables, such as email credentials. This file is not tracked by Git.
- `.gitignore` : Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as sensitive data or virtual environment folders.
- `email_template.mustache` : HTML template for the emails, using the Mustache templating language to insert product data.
- `fonts/` : Directory containing font files used for the subject line in the emails.
    - `arial.ttf` 
    - `impact.ttf` 
- `generate_images.py` : Script to generate the banner used in the emails, leveraging product data and images.
- `generated_banner/` : Directory to store the generated email banners.
- `image_templates/` : Directory containing templates for product images, if applicable.
- `product_data.json` : JSON file serving as a dictionary for the product data, including names, prices, image URLs, and other details.
- `products/` : Directory containing the actual product images referenced in `product_data.json` .
- `README.md` : Markdown file providing an overview of the project, usage instructions, and other details.
- `send_email.py` : Script to generate and send the email campaign, incorporating the generated banner and other necessary information.
## Key Files
### `email_template.mustache` 
This file serves as the HTML template for the emails. It allows dynamic insertion of product data into the email content using the Mustache templating language.

### `.env` 
The `.env` file contains environment variables, including the email address and password used to send the emails. It's essential for securely storing sensitive information and should not be tracked by version control systems like Git.

```bash
EMAIL_ADDRESS=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SERVER=
```

### `generate_images.py` 
This script generates the banner used in the emails. It processes the product data from `product_data.json` and utilizes images from the `products/` directory to create visually appealing banners.

### `product_data.json` 
`product_data.json` acts as a dictionary for the product data used in generating the email banners. It contains information such as product names, prices, image URLs, and other relevant details.

### `send_email.py` 
This script is responsible for generating and sending the email campaign. It incorporates the banner generated by `generate_images.py` and other necessary information such as the subject line, recipient list, and SMTP server details.

## Usage
Before running the scripts, ensure you have set up your environment variables in the `.env` file, including your email address and password.

### Steps to Run
1. Review and update the product data in `product_data.json`  to ensure accuracy and relevance.
2. Execute `generate_images.py`  to generate the product banners.
3. Run `send_email.py`  to send the email campaign to the specified recipients.
